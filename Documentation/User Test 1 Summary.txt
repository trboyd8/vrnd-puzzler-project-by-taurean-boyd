Q: How big do you feel in the scene?
A: I feel bigger than a normal person would based on the size of the gate. Assuming its 7 feet, I'm pretty close to it.

Q: How would you describe the atmosphere / mood in the scene?
A: Medieval. There's a gate and it feels like I'm in a castle or dungeon. Gloomy.  Dimly lit.

Q: Is there anything that seems off or difficult to understand?
A: The five balls are there and seem strange. Everything else looks fine. Looks like there's nothing outside of the gate - its just grey.

Conclusions:
1. May need to adjust the scale of the room or adjust the height of the camera.
2. Will need to give some kind of explanation to the user for the balls presence.
